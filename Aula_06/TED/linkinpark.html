        It starts with<br>
        One thing, I don't know why<br>
        It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
        Keep that in mind<br>
        I designed this rhyme to explain in due time<br>
        All I know<br>
        Time is a valuable thing<br>
        Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings<br>
        Watch it count down to the end of the day<br>
        The clock ticks life away<br>
        It's so unreal<br>
        Didn't look out below<br>
        Watch the time go right out the window<br>
        Trying to hold on, they didn't even know<br>
        I wasted it all<br>
        just to watch you go<br>
        I kept everything inside<br>
        And even though I tried<br>
        It all fell apart<br>
        What it meant to me will eventually be a<br>
        memory of a time when<br>
        <br>
        I tried so hard and got so far<br>
        But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br>
        I had to fall to lose it all<br>
        But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
        <br>
        One thing, I don't know why<br>
        It doesn't even matter how hard you try<br>
        Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to remind myself how<br>
        I tried so hard<br>
        In spite of the way you were mocking me<br>
        Acting like I was part of your property<br>
        Remembering all the times you fought with me<br>
        I'm surprised it got so [far]<br>
        Things aren't the way they were before<br>
        You wouldn't even recognize me anymore<br>
        Not that you knew me back then<br>
        But it all comes back to me [in the end]<br>
        I kept everything inside<br>
        And even though I tried<br>
        It all fell apart<br>
        What it meant to me will eventually be a<br>
        memory of a time when<br>
        <br>
        I tried so hard and got so far<br>
        But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br>
        I had to fall to lose it all<br>
        But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
        <br>
        I've put my trust in you<br>
        Pushed as far as I can go<br>
        for all this<br>
        There's only one thing you should know<br>
        <br>
        I've put my trust in you<br>
        Pushed as far as I can go<br>
        for all this<br>
        There's only one thing you should know<br>
        <br>
        I tried so hard and got so far<br>
        But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br>
        I had to fall to lose it all<br>
        But in the end it doesn't even matter<br>
