        Uh huh, life's like this<br>
        Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is<br>
        'Cause life's like this<br>
        Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is<br>
        <br>
        Chill out, what you yellin' for?<br>
        Lay back, it's all been done before<br>
        And if you could only let it be<br>
        You would see<br>
        I like you the way you are<br>
        When we're drivin' in your car<br>
        And you're talkin' to me one-on-one<br>
        But you've become<br>
        <br>
        Somebody else 'round everyone else<br>
        You're watchin' your back like you can't relax<br>
        You're tryin' to be cool<br>
        You look like a fool to me<br>
        Tell me<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?<br>
        I see the way you're actin' like you're somebody else<br>
        Gets me frustrated<br>
        Life's like this<br>
        You, and you fall and you crawl and you break<br>
        And you take what you get and you turn it into honesty<br>
        You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it<br>
        No, no, no<br>
        <br>
        You come over unannounced<br>
        Dressed up like you're somethin' else<br>
        Where you are and where it's at, you see<br>
        You're makin' me<br>
        Laugh out when you strike your pose<br>
        Take off all your preppy clothes<br>
        You know, you're not foolin' anyone<br>
        When you become<br>
        <br>
        Somebody else 'round everyone else<br>
        You're watchin' your back like you can't relax<br>
        You're tryin' to be cool<br>
        You look like a fool to me<br>
        Tell me<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to go and make things so complicated?<br>
        I see the way you're actin' like you're somebody else<br>

        You promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it<br>
        No, no, no<br>
        <br>
        No, no, no<br>
        No, no, no<br>
        No, no, no<br>
        <br>
        Chill out, what you yellin' for?<br>

        No no<br>
        <br>
        Why'd you have to go<br>
        And make things so complicated? (yeah, yeah)<br>
        I see the way you're actin' like you're somebody else<br>
        Gets me frustrated<br>
