        BRING ME TO LIFE<br>
        <br>
        How can you see into my eyes<br>
        like open doors<br>
        leading you down into my core<br>
        where I've become so numb?<br>
        Without a soul;<br>
        my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold,<br>
        until you find it there and lead it back home.<br>
        <br>
        (Wake me up.)<br>
        Wake me up inside.<br>
        (I can't wake up.)<br>
        Wake me up inside.<br>
        (Save me.)<br>
        Call my name and save me from the dark.<br>
        (Wake me up.)<br>
        Bid my blood to run.<br>
        (I can't wake up.)<br>
        Before I come undone.<br>
        (Save me.)<br>
        Save me from the nothing I've become.<br>
        <br>
        Now that I know what I'm without<br>
        you can't just leave me.<br>
        Breathe into me and make me real.<br>
        Bring me to life.<br>
        <br>
        (Wake me up.)<br>
        Wake me up inside.<br>
        (I can't wake up.)<br>
        Wake me up inside.<br>
        (Save me.)<br>
        Call my name and save me from the dark.<br>
        (Wake me up.)<br>
        Bid my blood to run.<br>
        (I can't wake up.)<br>
        Before I come undone.<br>
        (Save me.)<br>
        Save me from the nothing I've become<br>
        <br>
        Bring me to life.<br>
        (I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.)<br>
        Bring me to life.<br>
        <br>
        Frozen inside without your touch,<br>
        without your love, darling.<br>
        Only you are the life among the dead.<br>
        <br>
        All of this time<br>
        I can't believe I couldn't see<br>
        Kept in the dark<br>
        but you were there in front of me<br>
        I've been sleeping a one thousand years it seems.<br>
        I've got to open my eyes to everything.<br>
        Without a thought<br>
        Without a voice<br>
        Without a soul<br>
        (Don't let me die here/There must be something more.)<br>
        Bring me to life.<br>
        <br>
        (Wake me up.)<br>
        Wake me up inside.<br>
        (I can't wake up.)<br>
        Wake me up inside.<br>
        (Save me.)<br>
        Call my name and save me from the dark.<br>
        (Wake me up.)<br>
        Bid my blood to run.<br>
        (I can't wake up.)<br>
        Before I come undone.<br>
        (Save me.)<br>
        Save me from the nothing I've become.<br>
        <br>
        Bring me to life.<br>
        (I've been living a lie/There's nothing inside.)<br>
        Bring me to life.<br>
