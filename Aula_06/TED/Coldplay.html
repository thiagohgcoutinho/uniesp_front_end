    <p>
        Come up to meet you<br>
        tell you I'm sorry<br>
        You don't know how<br>
        Lovely you are<br>
        <br>
        I had to find you<br>
        Tell you I need you<br>
        And tell you<br>
        I set you apart<br>
        <br>
        Tell me your secrets<br>
        And ask me your questions<br>
        Oh let's go back<br>
        To the start<br>
        <br>
        Running in circles<br>
        coming up tails<br>
        Heads on a science apart<br>
        <br>
        Nobody said it was easy<br>
        It's such a shame for us to part<br>
        Nobody said it was easy<br>
        No one ever said<br>
        It would be this hard<br>
        Oh take me back to the start<br>

        I was just guessing<br>
        At numbers and figures<br>
        Pulling the puzzles apart<br>
        <br>
        Questions of science<br>
        Science and progress<br>
        Do not speak as loud<br>
        As my heart<br>
        <br>
        So tell me you love me<br>
        come back and haunt me<br>
        Oh, and I rush to the start<br>
        <br>
        Running in circles<br>
        chasing our tails<br>
        Coming back as we are<br>
        <br>
        Nobody said it was easy<br>
        It's such a shame for us to part<br>
        Nobody said it was easy<br>
        No one ever said<br>
        it would be so hard<br>
        I'm going back to the start<br>
        <br>
        Ooooohhhhhhh [x4]
