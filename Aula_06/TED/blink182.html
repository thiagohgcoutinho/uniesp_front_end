        I MISS YOU<br>
        <br>
        Hello there, the angel from my nightmare<br>
        The shadow in the background of the morgue<br>
        The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley<br>
        We can live like Jack and Sally if we want<br>
        Where you can always find me<br>
        We'll have Halloween on Christmas<br>
        And in the night we'll wish this never ends<br>
        We'll wish this never ends<br>
        <br>
        I miss you, I miss you<br>
        I miss you, I miss you<br>
        <br>
        Where are you? And I'm so sorry<br>
        I cannot sleep<br>
        I cannot dream tonight<br>
        I need somebody and always<br>
        This sick strange darkness<br>
        Comes creeping on so haunting every time<br>
        And as I stared, I counted<br>
        Webs from all the spiders<br>
        Catching things and eating their insides<br>
        Like indecision to call you<br>
        And hear your voice of treason<br>
        Will you come home and stop this pain tonight<br>
        Stop this pain tonight<br>
        <br>
        Don't waste your time on me you're already<br>
        The voice inside my head<br>
        (I miss you, I miss you)<br>
        Don't waste your time on me you're already<br>
        The voice inside my head<br>
        (I miss you, I miss you)<br>
        <br>
        Don't waste your time on me you're already<br>
        The voice inside my head<br>
        (I miss you I miss you)<br>
        Don't waste your time on me you're already<br>
        The voice inside my head<br>
        (I miss you I miss you)<br>
        Don't waste your time on me you're already<br>
        The voice inside my head<br>
        (I miss you I miss you)<br>
        Don't waste your time on me you're already<br>
        The voice inside my head<br>
        (I miss you I miss you)<br>
