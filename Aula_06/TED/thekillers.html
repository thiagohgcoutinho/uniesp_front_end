        I'm coming out of my cage<br>
        And I've been doing just fine<br>
        Gotta gotta be down<br>
        Because I want it all<br>
        It started out with a kiss<br>
        How did it end up like this<br>
        It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss<br>
        Now I'm falling asleep<br>
        And she's calling a cab<br>
        While he's having a smoke<br>
        And she's taking a drag<br>
        Now they're going to bed<br>
        And my stomach is sick<br>
        And it's all in my head<br>
        But she's touching his chest<br>
        Now, he takes off her dress<br>
        Now, let me go<br>
        <br>
        I just can't look its killing me<br>
        And taking control<br>
        Jealousy, turning saints into the sea<br>
        Swimming through sick lullabies<br>
        Choking on your alibis<br>
        But it's just the price I pay<br>
        Destiny is calling me<br>
        Open up my eager eyes<br>
        'Cause I'm Mr Brightside<br>
        <br>
        I'm coming out of my cage<br>
        And I've been doing just fine<br>

        I never...<br>
        I never...<br>
        I never...<br>
